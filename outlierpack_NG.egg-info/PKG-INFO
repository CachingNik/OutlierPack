        Output is the number of rows removed from the input dataset. The remaining rows of the dataset are streamed to a new csv file whose name is required as an input.
        
        `The no of rows removed: 5`
        
        *Note the outlier removal is performed using **IQR** method.*
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install outlierpack_NG`
        
        *Note the name has an underscore not a hyphen. If installation gives error or package is not found after installing, install as sudo.*
        
        *Recommended - test it out in a virtual environment.* 
        
        ## To use via command line
        `Outcli myData.csv newData.csv`
        
        First argument after outcli is the input csv filename from which the dataset is extracted. The second argument is for storing the final dataset after processing.
        
        ## To use in .py script
        ```
        from outlib.models import r_outliers
        r_outliers('myData.csv', 'newData.csv')
        ```
